# Hanseido for Anki

[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) - SRS free software - plugin that extracts KR-KR definitions from [National Institute of Korean Language's Dictionary](https://krdict.korean.go.kr/mainAction). Based on [Sanseido Definitions](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1967553085)

## How to Use

This plugin needs two fields:
  * Word - The Korean word to look up on NIKL
  * Sanseido - The field to insert the definition into

If you'd like to change the names of these fields, edit lines 23-24 in krdictDefsForAnki.py

To add definitions, find the card(s) in the browser window, select the ones you want to add definitions for, and click Edit > Regenerate Korean definitions

## Help on reading the definitions

NIKL's dictionary have English modes.
