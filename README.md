# Sanseido Definitions Plugin for Anki

Pulls simplified J-J definitions from www.sanseido.net's デイリーコンサイス国語辞典 (Daily Concise Kokugo Jiten).

## Usage

The plugin relies on having 2 fields,
  * Word - The word to look up on sanseido
  * Sanseido - The field to insert the definition into

If you'd like to change these, edit lines 20-21 in sanseidoDefsForAnki.py

To add definitions, edit a card in the browser window, and click Edit > Regenerate Sanseido definitions
