# Hanseido for Anki

[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) - SRS free software - plugin that extracts KR-KR definitions from [NAVER Dictionary](http://dic.naver.com/) or [National Institute of Korean Language's Dictionary](https://krdict.korean.go.kr/mainAction). Based on [Sanseido Definitions](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1967553085)

## How to Use

Hanseido needs two fields, as Sanseido:
  * Word - The Japanese word to look up on sanseido
  * Hanseido - The field to insert the definition into

If you'd like to change the names of these fields, edit lines 20-21 in sanseidoDefsForAnki.py

To add definitions, find the card in the browser window, and click Edit > Regenerate Hanseido definitions

## Help on reading the definitions

Both NAVER Dictionary and NIKL's dictionary have English modes.
