# Push Data Source

Geezeo provides robust transaction enrichment for partner and aggregated
accounts. The first step in any implementation is connecting the platform to a
data source for all partner accounts.

Geezeo provides a Push Data Source mechanism for integrations that require
real-time data enrichment.

Geezeoâ€™s Push Data Source allows partners to asynchronously submit transactions
via a batch JSON interface.

Each request submitted to the Push Data Source should provide a callback URL
where the results will be returned to. Once the Geezeo platform has completed
processing the batch, the platform will call back the URL with the results.

All requests to and from the Push Data Source will use JWT tokens to validate
authenticity as well as forced TLS with certificate validation.

Initial queuing requests will also respond with a unique token for that batch.
That token will also be on the response. That token should be used to tracking
and troubleshooting.

All data provided to this interface is considered an upsert and will replace the
data in the Geezeo platform.

## Callback URL

Requests should include a callback URL. Once the Geezeo platform has completed
processing the submitted batch, the platform will call the callback URL with the
payload in the POST body.

The request will come with a JWT token to ensure authenticity.
